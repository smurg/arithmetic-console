### How to run it

We are going to use a few node packages inside our app. The first thing to do after downloading the project is run the install command and then `start`:
```sh
# with yarn
yarn 
yarn start
# with npm
npm i
npm start
```
This will install all required dependencies and start a development server under `http://localhost:3000/`.
